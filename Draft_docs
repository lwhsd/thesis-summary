- challenging instance of image segmentation is the problem of automatically identifying semantically meaningful regions in an image. 
- This problem is often referred to as image labeling/semantic segmentation, since its goal is to associate each pixel in the image with a label denoting a semantically meaningful part.

 

Semantic segmentation:
- Ability to segment the images into different objects.
- Provide powerful insight to understand the world compare to object recognition or detection. 



-Pixel-wise:
-Instance wise:
